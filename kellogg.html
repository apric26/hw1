    <p> As a current student, we received two free tickets to the Music Bowl 2017, where the Northwestern Wildcats faced off against the
      University of Kentucky Wildcats. Though it was a little colder in Nashville than anticipated, heading to the game was awesome!
      We had great seats and in the end came out with a 24-23 victory.
