  <p> The Kellogg annual ski trip was the last adventure. Though I didn't ski, I had a great time.
    A group of non-skiers went tubing and dog sledding. This was the first time I did either so I was nervous and excited!
    The best part of dog sledding was that we were able to drive, or mush, the sled! But not all my time in Breck was spent outdoors.
    I also made it to the resort spa for a well-deserved massage. Breckenridge was super fun and would defintiely go back!
