    <p> After a hectic arrival, I landed in Santiago, Chile on January 2, 2018 for a Kellogg Exchange program.
       Only in country for one week, I took advantage of the free time we had outside of class time. I visited a look-out point near school, which had great views of Santiago.
       I also went to an internationally acclaimed restaurant, <strong>Boca Nariz</strong>, for a evening of great Chilean cuisine and wine pairings.
       What I appreciated the most from this exchange experience was getting to know the other Kellogg students better.
       I would recommend Kellogg Exchange to everyone!!
